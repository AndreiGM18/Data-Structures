## Now You See Me - Homework 1

### Description:

* The program implements a list of decks, each deck being in and of itself a list of cards, each card having a value and a
* symbol associated with it.
* It utilizes basic create, get, add, remove and free functions for a doubly linked list implementation.
* It works by accepting different commands from stdin.
* The program can: add a new deck with n cards, delete a deck, delete a card from a deck, add n cards to an existing deck,
* display the number of decks, display the number of cards in a deck, shuffle a deck, merge two decks, split a deck in
* two, reverse the order of cards in a deck, sort a deck, display a deck, as well as display all decks.
* If a command is not valid, or if it does not have enough arguments, it is ignored and an error message is displayed.
* If a provided index, be it a deck's or a card's, is invalid, an error message is displayed.
* If a provided card is invalid, it displays an error message.

### Comments regarding the homework:

* Using a circular doubly linked list might have made the implementation slightly better, both in terms of the number of
* exceptions in the add and remove functions, as well as in the efficiency of the get function.
* Having a tail pointer could also make the get function more efficient.
* The sort_deck function could also be improved, both by directly sorting the list itself and by utilizing better sorting
* algorithms.
* The same idea of directly changing the list can be applied to the reverse_deck function, so as to not delete it and
* replace it with a newly created one.
* I learned a lot more about void *, generic programming, memory allocation and trade offs while working on this homework.
* Creating a list of lists deepened my understanding of lists in general, as well as the way I tackle the functions
* associated with them.
* Since the code and comments are written in English, I found it appropriate to write the README in English as well. If
* this was not something I should have done, I do apologize.
